# My Harry Potter Spell Recognizer with PyTorch

I make a PyTorch AI model that can recognize their spells. Here are the spells my model can recognize based on the shapes you draw:

- 'Incendio': üî∫ (Like a triangle)
- 'Aqua': üìà (Like an oblique curve)
- 'Alohomora': üç≠ (Like a lollipop)
- 'Arresto': M (Just like the letter M)
- 'Leviosa': M (But make it a curvy M)
- 'Lumos': ‚ö° (Like a lightning bolt)

## How the Model Works

The AI model uses PyTorch, a cool deep learning framework I learned. It uses something called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn and recognize the spell shapes.

## Usage

Use the gui3.py, then you can try the power of this AI

# Warning

Be sure to type the correct path of the model when the computer ask your path

## Training the Model

I trained the model on a bunch of spell images that I labeled myself. The dataset has lots of examples of each spell, with different handwriting styles and variations. The better and more diverse the training data, the smarter the model becomes!

## Making the Model Better

I learned that there are lots of ways to make the model even better:

- More Data: The more examples the model has to learn from, the better it gets at recognizing different handwriting styles and variations.
- Data Augmentation: This is a fancy term for messing around with the images a bit (like rotating, scaling, and moving them) so the model doesn't get thrown off by different variations.
- Tweaking the Model: Trying out different architectures, layer setups, and other settings can make the model work better.
- Regularization: This helps stop the model from just memorizing the training data and makes it better at generalizing from what it has learned.

Remember, practice makes perfect. So keep tweaking, testing, and tuning!

## Heads Up!

Just a quick note: this project is just for fun and learning. It's not affiliated with or endorsed by Universal Studios or anything like that. The spell recognition might not be perfect, and a lot depends on the quality of the training data and the way the model is set up.
